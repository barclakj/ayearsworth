A few christmases ago I was messing about creating bubble maps - do doubt in some mince pie and port induced state of inebriation (quality of code is consequently as you'd expect).

I'd long forgotten about this until [Kent Becks](https://www.kentbeck.com/) recent post on [medium.com](https://medium.com/) about trying to understand [A Year's Worth](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/a-years-worth-c1cbc3085e9d) of effort.

This looked familiar and so with a little manipulation here's a simple utility to convert priority ordered stories into a visual bubble map.
